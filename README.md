# Technical Decisions and Actions


**1** USING PROGRAMATIC UI
- Reasons : 
    -- From experience, I believe programatic UI's help create flexibe and re-usable view as against storyboards
    
- Actions: The implementation of the ApiController
    -- Transition from storyboard to Programatic UI
    
- Solution
    -- Deleted Main.storyboard
    -- Create the UI's Programatically
    
    
**2** USING CLEAN ARCHITECTURE
- Reasons : 
    -- I needed to be able to test every entity independently, with flexible dependency injection
    
- Actions: 
    -- Structure the app properly to adhere to the MVVM Clean Architecture Pattern
